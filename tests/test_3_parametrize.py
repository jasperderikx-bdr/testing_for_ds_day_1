# -- Exercise 1 --
# Test the output of def number_of_positions() from hanoi/basics.py, parametrizing over number_of_disks.


# -- Exercise 2 --
# What happens to the test_ids of parametrized tests? (Use ```pytest --collect-only```.)
# Find out what "ids" does, when used in pytest.mark.parametrize(... ids= ...).


# -- Exercise 3 --
# Again, create a fixture that returns the start position of the puzzle but now parametrize the fixture such that it
# covers test cases for the tower of Hanoi up to 5 discs.
# Test that the starting position only consists of "a".


# For more advanced parametrization examples see: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/example/parametrize.html.
